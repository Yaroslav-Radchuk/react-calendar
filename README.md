# Events Calendar

Click [here](https://yaroslav-radchuk.github.io/react-calendar/) to see the demonstration.

In this application you can create, edit and delete your own calendar events. You can also mark important events in a different color and set the time.

I used these technologies: `React`, `React-icons`, `Tailwind`, `Material UI`, `Fetch`, `NPM`.
